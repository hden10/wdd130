    <h2>Hunter</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone. My name is Hunter. I am happily married and have two great sons. I am trying to get as much education as possible. I hope to try and maybe change careers if possible. I am going to work hard and try to use what I learn in this class and throughout my degree. I think an advantage of learning web design is that it puts you ahead of the game. The future is getting more on the side of technology so websites are going to be needed whether a company likes it or not.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for almost 25 years now. I love the scripture  John 15:13 "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." This is powerful to me because it reminds me that our Savior Jesus Christ gave his life for me and that he knows me and loves me. It is always comforting to know that I can make changes in my life after I have made a mistake. It is also comforting to know we can pray anytime to a loving Heavenly Father who is willing to help us with anything. </p>
