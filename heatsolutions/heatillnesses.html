            <h2> Heat Cramps </h2>
            <p>
                There are different types of heat illnesses that show similar symptoms to each other. The least-severe illness is heat cramps. Heat cramps are when your muscles in your legs, arms, and core start to stiffen up. This comes from a loss of sodium from the sweat. Something that helps are pickles and pickle juice helps relieve the cramps.

            <h2> Heat Exhaustion </h2>
            <p>
                Another illness is Heat exhaustion. This is from too much activity in the sun and there is an increase of blood pressure and increase in temperature. This makes you feel weak. If you get dizzy, nauseous, and feeling super sweaty then you are most likely experiencing heat exhaustion. This is the medium-severe one.

            <p>
                The most-severe heat related illness is heat stroke. This has very similar symptoms to heat exhaustion, but it can be deadly. If you get a body temperature over 104â„‰ then you should call 911 and get in the shade and cool off. Heat stroke can cause damage to the body and mind and even death.
