      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>“This heat is killing me!” How many times have you heard your friends say that? Well in Arizona this is a common phrase. Why? Because Arizona deserts are extremely hot, “on average 49 people die from the heat per year” (Arizona Department of Health Services, 2017). How can we decrease the number of deaths and illnesses from this heat? I am an Arizona native for over 25 years and I will use this website to inform people of the dangers of the Arizona Summer heat and give advice on how to not fall victim to the menace that we call “the valley of the sun”, without having to stay indoors all summer day.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This is for people who live in a place that has extreme heat. For example, Those who live in the southwest United States and others who live in that geographical area. This is also for those who spend a lot of time doing outdoor activities and have to deal with this heat. There are many people who have gotten extremely sick from heat exhaustion and have even died so this is for people trying to prevent any heat related illness to occur.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Heat Illnesses</h3>
      <p>
        There are different types of heat illnesses that show similar symptoms to each other. The least-severe illness is heat cramps. Heat cramps are when your muscles in your legs, arms, and core start to stiffen up. This comes from a loss of sodium from the sweat. Something that helps are pickles and pickle juice helps relieve the cramps. Another illness is Heat exhaustion. This is from too much activity in the sun and there is an increase of blood pressure and increase in temperature. This makes you feel weak. If you get dizzy, nauseous, and feeling super sweaty then you are most likely experiencing heat exhaustion. This is the medium-severe one. The most-severe heat related illness is heat stroke. This has very similar symptoms to heat exhaustion, but it can be deadly. If you get a body temperature over 104℉ then you should call 911 and get in the shade and cool off. Heat stroke can cause damage to the body and mind.

      <h3>Prevention</h3>
      <p>
        The heat is something that can make life miserable if not handled responsibly. There are things that a person can do to prevent the heat even before having to go out into it. One of the most important things that help prevent heat related illnesses is hydration. Water is the most important thing that you can use to stay hydrated. You should be drinking at least 8 cups of water a day, and that could vary depending on your activity level. You can tell if you are hydrated based on your urine color. The darker the urine the more dehydrated you are. Hydration is key because your kidneys and autonomic nervous system help control your sweat and that is what helps keep you cool. Caffeine and sugary beverages also make you more dehydrated so those should be avoided or limited. Sodium is loss in the sweat, so sports beverages and rehydrating packets are important to replace the electrolytes and sodium that was loss in sweat. There are things that we can use to help us to have fun in the heat without having to worry so much about these illnesses. One thing you can do is where a hat. Wide brimmed is usually the best to wear because it will protect your head, eyes, and neck. The brim will help shade the neck and this will help keep the body temperature down. Another thing that helps protect you is sunglasses. Sunglasses help protect the eyes by protecting them from UV rays and not damaging the cornea. Another thing that helps protect from the sun is sunscreen. This protects your skin from the UV rays and helps prevent skin cancer. Loose fitting clothing help you stay cool. Cool rags can help keep you cool while you are in the heat. Tight clothes trap the heat and cause irritation to the skin. As mentioned in the hydration article, water is the most important thing to keep cool and staying hydrated.
